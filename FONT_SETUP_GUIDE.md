# Halenoir Expanded Demi Font Setup Guide

## ✅ Font Configuration Complete

I've set up your Flutter app to use the **Halenoir Expanded Demi** font throughout the entire application. Here's what has been configured:

### 📁 Files Modified:
1. **`pubspec.yaml`** - Font family configuration (currently commented out)
2. **`lib/main.dart`** - Theme configuration with Halenoir font (currently commented out)
3. **`fonts/`** - Directory created for font files

### 🎯 Next Steps to Activate the Font:

#### Step 1: Get the Halenoir Expanded Demi Font
- Download the font from a font provider (Google Fonts, Adobe Fonts, etc.)
- Make sure you get the **Halenoir Expanded Demi** variant specifically

#### Step 2: Add the Font File
1. Place the font file in the `fonts/` directory
2. Rename it to exactly: `Halenoir-Expanded-Demi.ttf`
3. The file path should be: `fonts/Halenoir-Expanded-Demi.ttf`

#### Step 3: Uncomment the Configuration
1. In `pubspec.yaml`, uncomment the fonts section:
   ```yaml
   fonts:
     - family: Halenoir
       fonts:
         - asset: fonts/Halenoir-Expanded-Demi.ttf
           weight: 600
   ```

2. In `lib/main.dart`, uncomment the font configuration:
   ```dart
   theme: ThemeData(
     useMaterial3: true,
     fontFamily: 'Halenoir',
     textTheme: const TextTheme(
       // ... all the text styles with Halenoir font
     ),
   ),
   ```

#### Step 4: Update Dependencies
Run this command in your terminal:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

#### Step 5: Test the Build
Run this command to test:
```bash
flutter build apk --debug
```

### 🎨 What This Will Do:
- **All text** in your app will use the Halenoir Expanded Demi font
- **Consistent typography** across all screens and components
- **Professional appearance** with the expanded demi weight (600)
- **Beautiful headings** and body text throughout the app

### 📱 Current Status:
- ✅ Font configuration is ready
- ✅ Theme setup is complete
- ✅ Directory structure is created
- ⏳ **Waiting for font file to be added**

### 🔧 Troubleshooting:
If you encounter any issues:
1. Make sure the font file name is exactly `Halenoir-Expanded-Demi.ttf`
2. Ensure the file is in the `fonts/` directory (not a subdirectory)
3. Run `flutter clean` and then `flutter pub get` if needed
4. Check that the font file is not corrupted

### 💡 Alternative Font Names:
If you have a different variant of Halenoir, you can adjust the configuration:
- `Halenoir-Expanded-Demi.ttf` (recommended)
- `Halenoir-Expanded-DemiBold.ttf`
- `Halenoir-Expanded-DemiBold.otf`

Just make sure the filename in `pubspec.yaml` matches your actual font file name.

**Once you add the font file and uncomment the configuration, your entire app will have the beautiful Halenoir Expanded Demi typography! 🎨✨**
