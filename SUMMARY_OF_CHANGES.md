# Summary of Changes Made

## Overview
Fixed three main issues in the Flutter project management app:
1. **Projects not visible for any user**
2. **Logs not updated**
3. **Project-specific logs not working properly**

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Project Visibility (`lib/existing_project.dart`)
- **Before**: Used StreamBuilder which had issues with Firestore queries
- **After**: Implemented manual loading with `get()` method and proper error handling
- **Key improvements**:
  - Added authentication checks before loading projects
  - Comprehensive error handling and debugging
  - Better loading states and user feedback
  - Refresh functionality
  - Debug tools for troubleshooting

### 2. Fixed Logging System (`lib/logging.dart`)
- **Before**: Basic logging with potential sequence numbering issues
- **After**: Robust logging with fallback mechanisms and better error handling
- **Key improvements**:
  - Improved sequence numbering with transaction fallbacks
  - Better authentication checks
  - Automatic project timestamp updates
  - Comprehensive debugging information
  - Error recovery mechanisms

### 3. Enhanced Audit Log Page (`lib/audit_log_page.dart`)
- **Before**: Only showed all logs, no project-specific filtering
- **After**: Supports both all logs and project-specific logs
- **Key improvements**:
  - Added optional `projectId` parameter
  - Project-specific header and filtering
  - Better log display with project names
  - Improved filtering and search capabilities
  - Better visual distinction between different log types

### 4. Updated Project Details (`lib/project_details.dart`)
- **Before**: Limited log display in project details
- **After**: Added navigation to project-specific logs
- **Key improvements**:
  - "View All" button to see all project logs
  - Limited recent logs display to 5 entries for performance
  - Better integration with audit log system

## New Features Added

### 1. Project-Specific Audit Logs
- Click on any project to view its specific logs
- Shows project name in header
- Automatic filtering by project ID
- Better visual organization

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Better error messages for users
- Debug information for developers
- Retry mechanisms
- Firestore access testing tools

### 3. Improved User Experience
- Loading states for all operations
- Better visual feedback
- Refresh functionality
- Debug tools for troubleshooting

## Testing and Verification

### Manual Testing Steps
1. **Create a project** → Verify it appears in the list
2. **View existing projects** → Verify all projects are visible
3. **Click on a project** → Verify project details load
4. **Click "View All" in Activity Log** → Verify project-specific logs
5. **Edit a project** → Verify new log entry is created

### Debug Tools Available
- **Firestore Access Test**: Tests read/write permissions
- **Console Logging**: Detailed debug information
- **Error Messages**: User-friendly error displays
- **Refresh Buttons**: Manual refresh functionality

## Technical Improvements

### Performance
- Limited log display to prevent UI lag
- Better memory management
- Improved loading states
- Efficient Firestore queries

### Reliability
- Fallback mechanisms for sequence numbering
- Better error recovery
- Authentication checks
- Comprehensive error handling

### User Experience
- Better visual feedback
- Loading indicators
- Error messages
- Debug tools
