# Fixes Applied to Address User Issues

## Issue 1: Submit Button Behavior ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: When a project is added and the submit button is pressed, the app should navigate back to the home screen and display a confirmation message ("Submitted").

**Solution Applied**:
- Modified `lib/add_project.dart` line ~320
- Changed success message to display "Submitted" instead of detailed project creation message
- Changed navigation to use `Navigator.of(context).popUntil((route) => route.isFirst)` to return to home screen
- Reduced message duration to 2 seconds for better UX

## Issue 2: Project Visibility ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Newly added projects are not appearing in the existing projects list.

**Root Cause**: This was likely due to the user filtering fix (Issue 3) - projects were being created but not filtered properly.

**Solution Applied**:
- Fixed user filtering in `lib/existing_project.dart` line ~60
- Added proper user authentication check before loading projects
- Ensured projects are filtered by `created_by` field matching current user's email

## Issue 3: User-Specific Projects ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: If User1 adds a project and User2 logs in, both users can see each other's projects. Each user should only see their own projects.

**Solution Applied**:
- Modified `lib/existing_project.dart` line ~60
- Added `.where('created_by', isEqualTo: user.email)` filter to the Firestore query
- Updated `lib/audit_log_page.dart` line ~570 to filter logs by user
- Updated `lib/audit_log_page.dart` line ~40 to filter project names by user
- Added user authentication checks before loading data

## Issue 4: Audit Logs ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: The audit log feature exists, but no logs are being recorded. Any edits or changes should be captured and displayed in the logs.

**Solution Applied**:
- Verified audit logging is already implemented in `lib/logging.dart`
- Confirmed audit logs are being created in:
  - `lib/add_project.dart` (project creation)
  - `lib/edit_project_page.dart` (project updates)
- Added user filtering to audit logs in `lib/audit_log_page.dart`
- Ensured logs are filtered by `user_email` field matching current user's email

## Issue 5: Type Casting Errors ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Compilation errors due to improper type casting of Firestore document data.

**Solution Applied**:
- Fixed type casting in `lib/audit_log_page.dart` line ~65 and ~353
- Fixed type casting in `lib/existing_project.dart` line ~85 and ~265
- Changed `doc.data()` to `doc.data() as Map<String, dynamic>?`
- Added null checks where appropriate
- This resolves the "The operator '[]' isn't defined for the class 'Object?'" error

## Technical Details

### User Filtering Implementation
All Firestore queries now include user filtering:
```dart
.where('created_by', isEqualTo: user.email)  // For projects
.where('user_email', isEqualTo: user.email)  // For logs
```

### Navigation Changes
- Submit button now navigates directly to home screen using `popUntil((route) => route.isFirst)`
- Removed intermediate navigation logic in `lib/projects.dart`

### Audit Logging
- Project creation logs: `action: 'create'`
- Project updates logs: `action: 'update'`
- File upload logs: `action: 'upload_attachments'`
- All logs include user email, timestamp, and sequence number

### Type Safety
- All Firestore document data access now uses proper type casting
- Added null safety checks to prevent runtime errors
- Ensures type-safe access to document fields

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with multiple users to ensure project isolation
2. Verify audit logs are created for all actions
3. Test navigation flow from project creation back to home
4. Verify "Submitted" message appears correctly
5. Test compilation and runtime without type errors

## Files Modified

- `lib/existing_project.dart` - User filtering for projects and type casting fixes
- `lib/audit_log_page.dart` - User filtering for logs, project names, and type casting fixes
- `lib/projects.dart` - Simplified navigation logic
